Need not be conscious or performed by a person (note that agent/performer is not mentioned in this definition); can, but need not, be accompanied by vocalizations (not necessarily linguistic), but the gesture itself is not primarily noise-producing.

Rafsi of these forms must be memorized alongside their source gismu, since they are assigned arbitrarily (within some constraints). By contrast, rafsi of the forms CCVC and CVCC are always predictable, and match up one-for-one with gismu; these may be called {jvarafsi} (&apos;rule-rafsi&apos;).

The use of this word is not strictly only relevant to members of clade Dinosauria, although it does include them (and, specifically, modern birds, although it connotes ancientness and extinction unless it is part of an explicitly contrary or general context); its referent might also/alternatively include pterosaurs, icthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, dimetrodons, avemetatarsaliads, and perhaps even other ancient synapsids (in other words, any prehistoric quasi-reptilian vertebrate). As such, it is a qualitative word that bears no particular or strong attention or respect to genealogy, cladistics, taxology/taxonomy, or scientific/academic classification of these animals. Basically, any prehistoric animal the name of which ends in &quot;-saur&quot; can be so-described, as well as others. It probably should not reference more modern-like mammals proper.

jbovlaste-en.xml:101705:      <notes>Must be adjacent to a quotation marker (including terminator or delimiter) or &quot;{sedu&apos;u}&quot; or similar; it attaches to the/such a marker such that it is external to the scope of the quote/expression produced/contained/terminated by that marker. For example, in &quot;lu mu&apos;o&apos;u lu coi li&apos;u li&apos;u mu&apos;o&apos;u&quot;, the first instance of this word attaches to the second &quot;{lu}&quot; (because it is inside the quotation produced by the first &quot;lu&quot;) and the second instance of this word attaches to the second instance of &quot;{li&apos;u}&quot;; it cannot appear adjacent to &quot;{coi}&quot; in this example and yet function in application to the expressed quotation markers because it would then be inside all of the available quotations (nested, in this case), although such is allowed as a pure string (because being able to quote an expression such as &quot;He did say &quot;mu&apos;o&apos;u&quot;&quot; is utile). In a quotation (such as a &quot;lu&quot;-&quot;li&apos;u&quot; quotation) with two markers (initiation and termination), even if one of them is implicit: if this word appears before the quote (at its initiation), then it means that there is no relevant and material information preceding the original version of the presented quote which would drastically alter its interpretation (for example: if the original is &quot;not big&quot;, then &quot;big&quot; is technically a quote/substring thereof but there is information prior to this substring which materially alters the interpretation, namely &quot;not&quot;; likewise, cutting out the subject of a sentence which is being quoted and then using the quote in a context in which the subject is implied to be someone or something other than the original constitutes a material change in meaning due to incompleteness and this word would specify against that); if the word appears after the quote (at its termination), then it means that there is no relevant and material information following the original version of the presented quote which would drastically alter its interpretation (for example: if the original is &quot;he chose the men and the women&quot; but the presented quote/substring is &quot;he chose the men&quot; (in a context such that sexism is being accused), then there is information following the presented quote/substring which alters the interpretation, namely &quot;and the women&quot;); note that the interpretation-altering information need not immediately precede or follow the presented quote. For singly-marked quotes (such as by &quot;{zo}&quot;) it means that the presented quote/string/expression is complete on both ends (including being the complete word / all relevant rafsi in a lujvo). Modifying this word with &quot;-{nai}&quot; indicates that there definitely is a material change in the meaning of the quote due in part to completeness or lack of appropriate context (textual or otherwise). This word can be negated by &quot;{nai}&quot;, much like UI, but that would be unusual in effect. This word is a marker or flag of asserted good faith; thus, in effect, it functions as a reminder to the audience to check the quotation for the alleged completeness and fairness of representation. If quoting from foreign languages, terminal punctuation, such as &quot;.&quot; or paragraph breaks, and retention of original letter-casing (or indication thereof) must be explicitly included for the usage of this word to be appropriate and truthful. See also: &quot;{rau&apos;o}&quot;, &quot;{rau&apos;oi}&quot;, &quot;{boi&apos;o&apos;u}&quot; (for a solution to a technical catch with this word).</notes>

jbovlaste-en.xml:105820:      <notes>It applies to the entirety of the current bridi and all future ones until toggled again; multiple but separated usages of this word within the same bridi behave as if they were adjacent. &quot;Additive negation&quot; means that multiple negatives just intensify, but do not cancel, one another. For example in English: &quot;I ain&apos;t seen nothin&apos;&quot; means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. &quot;Multiplicative negation&quot; means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). &quot;I did not see nothing&quot; in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. &quot;I like cheese&quot; is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to &quot;I do not dislike cheese&quot;, which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (&quot;I am indeed very much so going!&quot; is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, &quot;I am going&quot;). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (&quot;I am indeed - not - going&quot; is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to &quot;I may be going&quot;; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (&quot;I am indeed not going&quot; is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).</notes>

jbovlaste-en.xml:175162:      <notes>For example: A person may know/have known/remember their grandparents, even if the latter are dead. The general emphasis is that the familiarity was gained in and might be applicable to only/primarily the past, or might strictly belong to the past/memory. Considering that events end and people change or die, it is hard to say that something which belongs strictly to the past or which may have evolved beyond recognition in some respects remains presently &apos;familiar&apos; ({slabu}), even if it was experienced formerly. This word uses the proposed/experimental rafsi &apos;-ve&apos;i-&apos; of the experimental gismu &quot;{vedli}&quot;; it also relies on &quot;slabu&quot; taking a greater connotation of familiarity/&apos;knowledge&apos; (in the Spanish &quot;conocer&quot; sense) due to the introduction of the experimental gismu &quot;{laldo}&quot; for other meanings of &quot;old&quot;.</notes>

This word uses experimental rafsi forms for the experimental gismu &quot;{vedli}&quot; and the {zevla} &quot;.{utka}&quot;, and relies on experimental gismu &quot;{laldo}&quot; in order to inform and restrict the meaning of &quot;{slabu}&quot;. Example: This word can be used in order to approximate the meaning of &quot;the living memory of anyone who was in the living memory of anyone who ... who was in the living memory of anyone who was in the living memory of $x_2$.</notes>

jbovlaste-en.xml:182796:      <notes>This works as all other Metric prefixes do. In decimal, $10^{(1/2)}=\sqrt{(10)}=3.16227766\dots$ (also expressed/represented in decimal). In different bases, this value may change; for example, in hexadecimal, it might be exactly four ($4$); however, this is an outstanding as-of-yet unsolidified area in the Lojban grammar/semantics (do &quot;{ki&apos;o}&quot; and Metric prefixes change according to the base?). This number is nice, as it is close to both 3 and and the circle constant pi ($\pi$) in decimal usage; these three values arise fairly frequently and a great trick in decimal Fermi estimation is to use their approximate identity in order to simplify expressions. Now, when the quantity is dimensionful (has units), if the mantissa approximates this value, then one can instead express the mantissa as approximately 1 and the unit as being augmented by this prefix. This word is also good for short-hand/quick expressions. This word has no English equivalent and is not part of the official set of SI prefixes, but it does generalize them. &quot;{xaudbo}&quot; = &quot;{kamre} {li} {dau} {te&apos;a} {fi&apos;u} {re}&quot; in decimal (if it generalizes for other bases, change &quot;dau&quot; into the base; in other words, &quot;dau&quot; generally becomes &quot;pano&quot; in such case, where the base is given by context). While this suggestion is not perfectly compatible with SI (which allows only one prefix at a time), the negative-power version of this (&quot;kamre li dau te&apos;a {ni&apos;u} fi&apos;u re&quot;, where &quot;dau&quot; has the aforementioned caveats; $1\times10^{-(1/2)}$) can just be expressed as a lujvo/rafsi/tanru containing both &quot;{decti}&quot; and this word (as veljvo/selrafsi/{seljavytertau}), because $A^{(-1/2)}=\sqrt{(1/A)}=A^{(+1/2)}/A$, and $A$ (ten in at least decimal) is the base. A &quot;{xaudbydectre}&quot; is a single unit which (in decimal) happens to approximate an imperial/U.S. customary foot (unit).

jbovlaste-en.xml:183506:      <notes>Refers to a particular, infamous cultural phenomenon in the Lojban community wherein many conversations between speakers in or tangential to Lojban tend to very quickly devolve into an argument over grammar, semantics, or usage, with the result that it becomes difficult if not impossible to hold an ordinary conversation in the language on any subject in forums where this behavior is not explicitly discouraged.

jbovlaste-en.xml:185092:      <notes>n can be any nonnegative integer, (countable) infinity, or vague (in which case it could mean a nonnegative integer or (countable) infinity). The default value of n is vague/elliptical, thus transforming this word into a 0-ary operator. The output is a string of digits, not a number; thus, it automatically attaches to a string of PA&apos;s if immediately preceding this word; following digits must be concatenated on; it might be necessary to convert this string into a number (especially if it is isolated and/or is being acted upon an operator that is defined as desired for numbers but not for digits or strings), but the conversion may be automatic according to the grammar (at least in some contexts). {xo&apos;e} is considered to represent exactly one &apos;digit&apos; (really: PA member) in the given base until it is converted into a number. Since {pi} belongs to PA, technically at least zero {xo&apos;e}&apos;s can actually be meant to be radix point(s); at most, the total allowable number of radix points in a digit string, less the number of explicitly mentioned {pi}&apos;s that occur therein (within the macrodigit), is the number of {pi}&apos;s that can be referenced elliptically by this means. {ma&apos;u} and {ni&apos;u} are possible references for microdigits where allowed by the base.  This word &apos;knows where it lives&apos;, meaning that it will only produce digit strings that are composed of PA&apos;s that are allowed by the base and notation given the rest of the context, which form allowed macrodigits, and which will represent part of a context-allowed number. Proposed rafsi: &quot;-xon-&quot;, where the default case (n is vague) is assumed (thus, as a rafsi, &quot;-xon-&quot; represents any number that is expressible in the base by a string of concatenated digits and radix point(s) and which makes sense/satisfies implicit conditions placed upon it (such as signum, or being integer, etc.); this meaning is usually described by using variables &quot;n&quot; or &quot;x&quot; in English, such as in: &quot;n-ary&quot;, &quot;n-many&quot;, &quot;x-meter-long&quot;, etc.).</notes>
jbovlaste-en.xml:185165:      <notes>If one owns five cats, then in normal Lojban grammar, if they were to say &quot;I have two cats&quot;, then they would be incorrect/lying; numbers are exact. But often, allowing for such statements is desirable, at least because one can be less mindful of the exactitude requirement. For example, some criminal statutes say things like &quot;if the defendant has four criminal history points, then...&quot;, but they actually mean &quot;if the defendant has four or more criminal history points, then...&quot;. Likewise, it is almost always a lie in Lojban to say &quot;I am $t$ years old&quot;, because one is almost never exactly $t$ years old (this expression is usually the result of rounding down to the nearest integer or half-integer); one should actually say &quot;I am between $t$ years old and $t+1$ years old&quot; – but toggling the grammar with this word would more closely approximate the natlang phrase (although an eighty-year-old could still correctly say, perhaps with some philosophical correctness too, that they are six years old). An even number of uses of this word return the grammar back to numeric exactitude. The &quot;at least&quot; interpretation applies to rafsi as well: a car is a bicycle after this word has been used an odd number of times because &quot;bicycle&quot; would actually mean &quot;at-least-two-wheeler&quot;. Again, this could have some applicability in law, such as when banning the usage of vehicles, for example. &quot;{su&apos;e} will operate normally under this word (so, &quot;su&apos;e {re}&quot; would mean &quot;at most 2&quot; and not &quot;at most at-least-2&quot;; meaning that 3 is definitely excluded from the realm of possible numbers), but &quot;su&apos;o&quot; is converted so as to mean &quot;exactly&quot; (given that it is otherwise useless; in other words, the exactitudes of unmarked numhers and &quot;su&apos;o&quot;-marked ones swap with one another). This word does not affect brivla or modals, unless the former involve numeric rafsi; in particular, &quot;{zmadu}&quot;, &quot;{satci}&quot;, &quot;{mau}&quot;, and the like are not affected. This word affects non-integer numbers as well, as demonstrated by the time example; after this toggle, one could accurately say that Cleopatra died five hundred years ago (because she died ealier than that). Explocit approximation via &quot;{ji&apos;i}&quot; is unaffected by this word, in a manner similar to &quot;su&apos;e&quot;. Technically, &quot;1+1 =2&quot; is still true under this toggle effect because the sum of at least 1 with at least 1 is indeed at least 2. Both exactitude and this modification to it have their respective problem cases, so use each carefully.</notes>

Quotes an utterance (must be grammatical) and converts it (as a whole) into a single rafsi with the meaning of &quot;something to do with the referent of &quot;[insert quoted text]&quot;&quot;.

This word is useful for forming quotes and mathematical expressions (formal, evaluated, or otherwise) into lujvo. This rafsi is assumed to begin the next word if the preceding text/utterance does not end with an otherwise standalone and ungrammatical rafsi (the grammar in such a situation should be discussed); in order to connect it as a rafsi within a lujvo that began before it, precede the quotation with {zei}. In order to finish a lujvo or treat the quotation as a brivla on its own, follow it with {co&apos;e}, which is treated as if the preceding utterance (the quote) is a single word followed immediately by {zei}; in order to string multiple ZEIhEI-ZEIhOI rafsi together follow this formula: zei&apos;ei broda zei&apos;oi co&apos;e zei zei&apos;ei brode zei&apos;oi (co&apos;e (zei...))... .

jbovlaste-en.xml:189475:      <notes>Terminated by {zei&apos;oi}. Begins a quote of a grammatical utterance. Between each word in the utterance, {zei} is to be interpreted and any grouping that might be applied is left-grouping. In other words, {zei} is distributed left-groupingly between each word; each word is treated on its own, individually; the quote is not treated as a whole. The final word is interpreted to have {zei} after it as well (this is a quirk of {zei&apos;oi}), thus the quote is a string of rafsi, left-groupingly considered to be a rafsi. In order to end the lujvo formed with such a quote, follow it by {co&apos;e}. This word compactifies large {zei}-clauses/-statements. For the perhaps generally more useful, if slightly more ambiguous, quote marker that treats the quote as a whole entity and converts it singly and wholly into a rafsi (rather than a rafsi string, as is done by this word), see: {zei&apos;ei}. This word works as {zei&apos;ei} does in all other regards (including as a marker for a new word (specifically a lujvo) unless preceded by {zei} or possibly by a standalone and otherwise ungrammatical rafsi). For the purpose of quoting with {ra&apos;oi}, the result of a {zei&apos;ei&apos;au}-quote is treated as a single rafsi.</notes>

jbovlaste-en.xml:190976:      <notes>Refers to a somewhat controversial idea that formal {rafsi} should be abolished, with coiners of {lujvo} being able to pick rafsi other than the formally assigned ones.

jbovlaste-en.xml:191146:      <notes>Applies to any categorizer particle/word/morpheme/lexeme/string/unit; does not necessarily have to be a single jborafsi (even in Lojban zi&apos;evla). Does not include the hyphen letter, nor the rest of the word (including any letter prefixed thereto if the rest of the word would otherwise start with a vowel). Quote the empty string (lu li&apos;u) if the explicit categorizer is absent; in general, the quote will likely be improper in Lojban.

jbovlaste-en.xml:191157:      <notes>Quotation may be improper. This is the part of the zi&apos;evla that carries the specific meaning of the word; in stage-4 fu&apos;ivla, the entirety of the word is this remainder; the categorizer rafsi and hyphen letter(s) are not included.

jbovlaste-en.xml:192779:      <notes>Angular/curling direction: counterclockwise. The orientation of the path determines x4 but does not factor into consideration for x3. Further glosses: counterclockwise, locally leftward, left-turning (with no bulk translation) in a way that would be characterized as &quot;positive&quot; by the right-hand rule (aligned with and in the direction of a basis vector, at least for a given component). x1 is right-handedly/counterclockwise(ly) oriented relative to x2 on/along x3 in frame of reference x4  x1 is right-handed (one sense) from x2 [more accurately: moving from x2 to x1 requires a(n imaginary) motion that is right-handed along x3 as seen in frame/orientation/perspective x4]. x1 is to the path-following left of x2 (where the path is connected; as such, x1 is also be to the path-following right of x2, although there is an implication that the former is the smaller (or equal-length) path). See also: {dutso}, {za&apos;ei} (vectorial cross product), {zu&apos;au} (modal). Proposed short rafsi: -zuc-, -zu&apos;a-. (If “zn” ever becomes a permissible initial consonant pair, krtisfranks proposes that “-zna-” become a rafsi of this word- it makes {zucna} and {dutso} more parallel in lujvo formation, and he is of the opinion that this word is useful and basic enough to warrant such a prized rafsi assignment; after this addition, the current two rafsi proposals can be done away with, reassigned, maintained, vel sim. as desired by the community at the time. In particular, he recognizes that “-zu’a-” might be confusing as a rafsi for this word while being a modal cmavo for {zunle}; but he does believe that this word deserves a vowel-final short rafsi.)</notes>
